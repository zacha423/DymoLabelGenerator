# DymoLabelGenerator
Dymo Label Generator is a web based utility to assist in creating templates for our common labels with Dymo Connect. DymoLabelGenerator provides several templates to mark and inventory devices that have been returned to a helpdesk.

## Adding Additional Templates
1. Create your new label in DymoConnect
2. Assign Custom names for each field you want to dynamically change.
3. Add a route for the new label template, a PUG template file, and any additional JS files needed.
