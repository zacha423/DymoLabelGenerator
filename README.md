# DymoLabelGenerator
Dymo Label Generator is a web based utility to assist in creating templates for our common labels with Dymo Connect. DymoLabelGenerator provides several templates to mark and inventory devices that have been returned to a helpdesk.


# Label Types
## Return Label
Track devices that have been returned to the helpdesk. Who does it belong to and why do we have it?

## Voucher Label
Storage Room: Someone has left the University and is higher than .75 FTE. Issue a voucher for the device if they will be rehired.

## Bumpdown Label
Storage Room: Someone has left the university / a device has been returned and it does not belong to a specific role. Add this to the available bumpdown stock.

## Device Assignment Label
A device is going to someone. Who is it for and what is the ticket for deploying the computer?

## New Device Label
Storage Room: This is a new/refurbished device that was recently purchased and needs processed.
